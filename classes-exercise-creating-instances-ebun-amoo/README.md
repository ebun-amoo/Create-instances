# Classes Exercise: Creating Instances

Please edit the `main.py` file and add your code at the bottom of the file.

Using the Point class that is already there in the file, please do this:

* Create an instance of the Point class with coordinates (0, 0) and put it in a variable named `first_instance`
* Create an instance of the Point class with coordinates (0, 2) and put it in a variable named `second_instance`
* Create an instance of the Point class with coordinates (2, 0) and put it in a variable named `third_instance`
* On `first_instance`, write a call to the `move_right()` method.
* Try running the program, and confirm that there are no errors that show up.
